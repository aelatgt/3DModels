This folder contains the 3D models used and/or developed by Akshay Sathiya during the Spring 2021 semester.

1. The `photoframe.blend` file contains the 3D model of the first photo frame Akshay Sathiya developed (which is larger, made from several cube-based objects, and has inclined edges) and the 3D model of the second photo frame he developed (which is sleeker and made from one cube-based object). Akshay developed the second photo frame model by following Jisu Park's Blender tutorial, which is linked here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wS9K4pr5Mqc&feature=youtu.be. The image used in the photo frames is `wallpaper.jpeg`, which comes from here: https://www.walpaperlist.com/2020/01/cool-wallpapers-4k-ultra-hd.html. The image address is https://cdn.statically.io/img/wallpaperaccess.com/full/829215.jpg. 
2. The `iphonepres.blend` file contains the 3D model of a podium that Akshay Sathiya developed. This podium was based on the podium where Steve Jobs unveiled the first iPhone. The image used in this model is `iphonescene.png`, which shows an iPhone's call screen. The image comes from here: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/06/29/what-it-was-like-to-stand-in-line-for-the-first-iphone/.

3. The `buzz.blend` file contains a 3D model of Buzz, Georgia Tech's mascot, created by William Colin Freeman. 
4. The `original_glasses.blend` file contains a 3D model of glasses developed by Andrew Nazareth. This model was modified by Akshay Sathiya so that it could be successfully rendered in an A-Frame scene, and the `glasses.blend` file contains the modified glasses model. 
5. The `scene.blend` file contains the 3D model of the AR glasses exhibit of the futures room, which contains the `buzz.blend` and `glasses.blend` models as described above.
