Lauren's models:

DisplayCaseFinal (1):
    Blender model of empty display case
    
DisplayCaseWithGlasses:
    Blender model of display case with Andrew's glasses model inside

DisplayCaseWithPoster:
    Blender model of display case with "Ready Player One" poster inside. You will likely have to re-import the texture image (labeled "RP1.jpg" in this repo) for the poster itself     because otherwise the poster will just look pink.
    
Final Taxonomy of Futures Map:
    Model of map stand to be placed at the spawn point of the Taxonomy of Futures Room. You will likely have to re-import the texture image (labeled "Taxonomy of Futures Map.png"     in this repo) for the map itself because otherwise the map part will just look pink.
    
FinalTaxonomyOfFuturesRoom:
    Blender model of the Taxonomy of Futures Room. The "Final Taxonomy of Futures Map" is intended to be a map of this space.
